# Schedule Master
This is a schedule Website created by David Gray and Gracie Wright for the UVA course CS 4640
 
 This website uses PHP and a XAMPP Apache server and a MySQL database. For usage, first install XAMPP, guide at provided link

http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~up3f/cs4640/supplement/XAMPP-setup.html

Second, clone this git repository into the htdocs folder

Third, start the XAMPP Apache and MySQL servers

Lastly, go to 

http://localhost/dg9hm_webpage/login.php

There, you can create a new account (or log in if this is not the first time using it), create events, change the website aesthetics using the Settings button, inspect events, and after you are done with the site, you can log out. Even if you turn off XAMPP features, and turn it on at a later time, your changes to the schedule will remain in place. 

This project was co created by David Gray and Gracie Wright and all contents of the website are ours. This is public for the purposes of showing off the website, and so people who may be struggling to start with a PHP website can see that this can be done (This website was created in 3 weeks over COVID).
